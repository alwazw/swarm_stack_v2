üö® Critical Issues and Immediate Cleanup Plan

‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues Requiring Immediate Action

Critical Issues Identified

Port Conflicts: Some services (e.g., former Organizr 443 binding) are incorrectly binding to forbidden host ports ($80/443$).

Inconsistent Naming: Test containers (alertmanager_test) and orphaned containers are still running.

Network Complexity: $14$ active networks suggest over-segmentation and management overhead.

Security Concerns

Missing SSL: No automatic HTTPS implementation is currently in place.

Plaintext Credentials: Some credentials stored in plaintext (violates recommended README.md principles).

Secret Permissions: Some secret files have weak permissions ($664$).

Direct Port Access: Services are accessible directly via IP/Port without a reverse proxy or SSO layer.

Performance Issues (Contributing to High Load)

High Load: System load consistently averaging $2.0 - 2.5$ (concerning).

Memory Waste: Multiple Grafana instances consuming $2.2\text{GB}$ total.

Excessive Redundancy: $5$ dashboard services are running (Heimdall, Homarr, Homepage, Organizr, Homar) with overlapping functionality.

Zombie Processes: $12-13$ zombie processes detected.

üóëÔ∏è Cleanup Strategy: Removing Rogue Projects

The analysis identified containers running from old, archived Docker Compose files, leading to resource waste and conflicts.

Rogue Docker Compose Files Found (Partial List):

/home/alwazw/docker/manus/alwazw_swarm/docker-compose-final.yml

/home/alwazw/docker/manus/alwazw_swarm/docker-compose-complete.yml

/home/alwazw/docker/alwazw_swarm_fixedbymanus_1/docker-compose.yml

/home/alwazw/docker/archive/...

/home/alwazw/docker/activepieces/...

Current Docker Compose Projects to Be Cleaned:

full_stack: running($7$) - LEGACY PROJECT

delete: running($1$) - TEMPORARY (cloudflared_temp_delete)

activepieces: running(X) - LEGACY PROJECT

Cleanup Strategy Required (Step-by-Step):

Backup All Compose Files before deletion.

Stop Containers from legacy projects (full_stack, activepieces).

Remove Compose Files from /home/alwazw/docker/manus/ directory.

Clean Archive Directories that contain old compose files.

Keep delete directory temporarily for cloudflared_temp_delete access.
