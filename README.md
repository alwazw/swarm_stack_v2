‚ö° Manus Swarm 90 - Integrated Enterprise & Homelab Stack

A comprehensive, production-ready Docker Swarm stack focused on a secure, integrated, and modular infrastructure for both enterprise testing and advanced homelab environments.

üöÄ Quick Start & Principles

Core Principles of the Integrated Ecosystem

Ingress: Traefik acts as the single entry point for all web services, automatically managing load balancing and SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt).

Authentication: Authelia (preferred) or Authentik provides a central Single Sign-On (SSO) layer for all services via Traefik middleware.

Data Segregation: Databases (Postgres, MariaDB, MSSQL) and Caching (Redis) run on a dedicated internal network, isolated from web traffic.

Configuration Management: Variables are strictly separated:

.env: Project settings (Domain, TZ, Ports, Paths).

SECRETS.txt: High-entropy passwords (used to populate the sensitive variables in the .env file). For production Swarm deployments, these should be converted to true Docker Secrets.

Prerequisites

Linux Host (Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian 11+)

16GB+ RAM (32GB+ recommended for full stack deployment)

Docker and Docker Compose (or Docker Engine for Swarm)

Installation

Clone & Configure:

git clone [https://github.com/alwazw/manus_swarm_90.git](https://github.com/alwazw/manus_swarm_90.git)
cd manus_swarm_90/configs/production
# Copy and edit the configuration files
cp .env.example .env
cp SECRETS.txt.example SECRETS.txt


Crucially, populate the secrets in your new SECRETS.txt and copy those values to the corresponding fields in your .env file.

Deploy the Stack (Docker Swarm):

# Ensure Docker Swarm is initialized (if not already)
docker swarm init
# Deploy the stack using the configured files
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml --with-registry-auth manus-swarm

üîß Configuration

All sensitive variables in the included docker-compose.yml are pulled directly from your local .env file.

Volumes and Storage Organization

The project assumes a standardized local storage layout:

Volume Name

Usage

Description

postgres_data

/var/lib/postgresql/data

Persistent data for all PostgreSQL services.

mariadb_data

/var/lib/mysql

Persistent data for all MariaDB/MySQL services.

app_configs

/opt/config/...

Configuration files for non-database services (Grafana, Traefik, etc.).

user_data

/data/files/...

Large file storage for Nextcloud, Syncthing, Media.

This centralized approach makes backup and recovery significantly easier.
